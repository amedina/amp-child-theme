# amp-child-theme
Provides AMP Content support for AMP Compatible WP Theme.
I am evaluating the decomposition of the AMP plugin into a modular set of filters providing the glue and logic to combine embed handlers and filters (formerly know as sanitizers). The idea is to create filters for each of the building blocks of a Wordpress theme, such as the content, the header, the footer, etc.
